title: Generalize program to support arbitrary number of divisors with custom outputs for each one.
desc: |-
  Modify program to support an arbitrary number of divisors with custom outputs for each one.
  
  For instance, duplicate functionality with a map of { 3, fizz, 5, buzz, 15 fizz buzz }
  
   { 3, fizz, 5, buzz,  8 sprite }
  
  [ ] Combinations should be automatically appended.

  - I think the approach will be to cook a list of multiples that the base fizzbuz will use.
