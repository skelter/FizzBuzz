title: Generalize program to support arbitrary number of divisors with custom outputs for each one.
desc: |-
  Modify program to support an arbitrary number of divisors with custom outputs for each one.
  
  For instance, duplicate functionality with a map of { 3, fizz, 5, buzz, 15 fizz buzz }
  
   { 3, fizz, 5, buzz,  8 sprite }
  
  [ ] Combinations should be automatically appended.
  
  [ ] Submit via github or bitbucket

  - the primary logic seems complete

  - I think the approach will be to cook a list of multiples that the base fizzbuz will use.

    I'm pretty tired so I would recommend someone reviewing this if this were real-world.  Perhaps check it into branch or even a copy of a repo, and not push these particular changes just yet.  But, this is for fun, so it's committed.  I ended up reviewing discrete math from my college
    days and finding that the combinatorial problem mapped to enumerating a powerset.  If you map that to bits of an integer, it becomes
    easy enough to generate.  I think I got it.  We'll see how the review goes tomorrow.
