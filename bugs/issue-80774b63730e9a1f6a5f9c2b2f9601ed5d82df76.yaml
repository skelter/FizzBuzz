title: Simply by pushing iteration over terms into the fizzbuzz method.
desc: |-
  We can skip the powerset and expansion of terms by pushing the iteration over the terms into the fizzbuzz method. 
  This might simplify the code and safe us a discrete math degree.

    Yeah, was much simpler if you just iterate in the inner fizzbuzz method.  An interesting problem remains, however, that it can be order
    dependent.  We could sort.  Might need to check with the client.
